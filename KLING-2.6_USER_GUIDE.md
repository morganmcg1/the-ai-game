Welcome to Experience KLING VIDEO 2.6: Let's "See the Sound, Hear the Visual"

Previously, KLING's video models could only generate "silent visuals". Creators had to manually find voiceovers, add sound effects, and adjust the pace—an overly complex process that made it hard to achieve true immersion. 

Now, the all-new VIDEO 2.6 Model is available: it generates visuals, natural voiceovers, matching sound effects, and ambient atmosphere in a single pass, bridging the worlds of "sound" and "visuals". Whether inputting text or uploading an image, you can instantly create a dynamic video that's complete, with sound, rhythm, and immersion—no more tedious editing.Compared to previous "silent" models, VIDEO 2.6 offers a comprehensive upgrade:

No more "silent films": Visuals, voice, and sound effects are generated together, with seamless integration of camera rhythm and emotional tone, transforming content from "viewable" to "immersive".
Full control over sound: Choose who speaks, what they say, and the emotion behind it. Generate ambient and special effects sounds freely, adjusting the pace and atmosphere to fit various creative needs.
Effortless creation for beginners: No complex operations required—just input text or images, and the system will automatically handle sound and visual details. Ideal for content creators and small studios to quickly produce professional videos.
1. KLING's First "Native Audio" Model is Now Live!
With the VIDEO 2.6 Model, we are introducing the "Native Audio" feature for the first time: a single generation that simultaneously produces video visuals and complete audio, including voiceovers, sound effects, and ambient sounds. This feature achieves seamless coordination in rhythm, emotion, and narrative expression, delivering a true "see what you hear" audio-visual experience.

This upgrade focuses on:

Audio-Visual Coordination: Voice rhythm, ambient sounds, and visual actions are closely aligned, eliminating the disconnect between "visuals and separate audio."

Audio Quality: Supports various sound types such as voice, sound effects, and ambient sounds, with cleaner sound quality and richer layers, closely mimicking real mixing effects.

Semantic Understanding: Strong semantic comprehension of text descriptions, spoken language, and complex storylines in different contexts, ensuring more accurate interpretation of creator intentions and delivering content that better meets needs.

For the creation process, KLING 2.6 provides two efficient creation paths centered around the core need of "fast audio-video content generation from text/images".

Text-to-Audio-Visual: From a sentence to a complete audio-visual video.

Image-to-Audio-Visual: Bring static images to life with sound and motion.

Input text to generate a video with voiceovers, sound effects, and ambient sounds.

4.1 Key Tutorial — Multicharacter Dialogue Prompt Examples and Guidelines
Guidelines

Core Principles

Prompt Guidelines and Examples

Incorrect Example (Prone to Model Failure)

P1. Structured Naming

Character labels must be unique and consistent.

[Character A: Black-suited Agent] and [Character B: Female Assistant]. ❌ Avoid using pronouns or synonyms. 

[Agent] says... Then, he says...

P2. Visual Anchoring 

Bind the dialogue to the character's unique actions. 

First describe the action, then follow with the dialogue: The black-suited agent slams his hand on the table. [Black-suited Agent, angrily shouting]: "Where is the truth?" 

[Black-suited Agent]: "Where is the truth?" (The model won't know who slammed the table)

P3. Audio Details

Assign unique tone and emotion labels to each character.

[Black-suited Agent, raspy, deep voice]: "Don't move." [Female Assistant, clear, fearful voice]: "I'm scared." 

[Man] says... [Woman] says... (The voice characteristics are too vague and can confuse the model) 

P4. Temporal Control

Use clear linking words to control the sequence and rhythm of dialogue.

.... [Black-suited Agent]: "Why?" Immediately, [Female Assistant]: "Because it's time." ⚠️ (Optional strong constraint: Insert "this is when the speaker switches" between the two.) 

[Black-suited Agent]: "Why?" [Female Assistant]: "Because it's time." (The model may generate a continuous speech from one character)

5. Kling VIDEO 2.6: Voice Control for Image to Audio & Video
5.1 Feature Overview
Have you ever struggled with inconsistent voices or a lack of personalisation when creating content across multiple videos or characters? With Kling VIDEO 2.6, we're introducing the all-new Voice Control feature. Simply select a target voice, and the model will accurately replicate its vocal characteristics to perform your specified content. The workflow is effortless — just provide visual input + voice prompt + target voice, and generate high-quality audio-visual content in seconds.

 

With Voice Control, you can now achieve:

Stable, High-Fidelity Voice Output: The voice remains consistent throughout the entire video, accurately preserving the target timbre. Ideal for long-term voice consistency across IP characters, brand personas, and recurring roles.
Flexible Style Adaptation: A single voice can be seamlessly applied to multiple scenarios—such as narration, conversation, or speeches—automatically adapting tone, rhythm, and delivery style to match the context.
Natural Cross-Language Performance: No additional configuration required. Voices trained in one language can naturally perform dialogue in another (e.g., Chinese ↔ English), with smooth pronunciation and expressive consistency. Currently supports bidirectional Chinese–English adaptation.
Prompt-Based Voice Binding: With simple prompts like [Character@VoiceName], the model automatically binds voices to specific characters—making multi-character dialogue with distinct voices effortless.

5.2 Platform User Guide
Before using this feature, please ensure that all input content and any audio you publish while using Voice Control are either your original work or properly authorised.

 

The Voice Control feature in VIDEO 2.6 is now available on both Web and App platforms. It is currently supported in Image-to-Audio & Visual (Image → Audio/Video); Text-to-Audio & Visual is not available yet. Below is a guide on how to create a custom voice and use Voice Control effectively.

How to Create a Custom Voice:

Web Platform - UI

App Platform - UI









Steps

1. Click [+ Create New Voice], and choose one of the following methods:

Upload from Local: Web platform supports audio/video files such as mp3, wav, mp4. App platform only supports video files. Requirements:
Video duration is 5-30 seconds, with single person speaking and avoid overlapping voices;
Neutral emotion, steady speaking rate and no obvious background noises.
Select from History: You can use voices from [Assets] or [History Upload]. Not supported: sound effects or special-effect works, videos generated before VIDEO 2.6, or videos created in VIDEO 2.6 without Native Audio enabled, as these cannot provide stable voice extraction
2. After upload, the system will automatically extract the voice. You can then name or delete the extracted voice. Up to 200 voices can be created in total.

How to use voices:

Method One: Quick start with symbol "@"

Method Two: Manual selection from the Voice List









Steps

Enable Native Audio in the creation panel.
Type @ in the input box to open the voice dropdown.
Select a voice from the list or type keywords to match and bind it.
Open the Select Voice list in the creation panel.
Click a desired voice to bind it.
Voice

Specified Voice Binding：To assign a specific voice to a specific character, add @VoiceName immediately after the character name in the prompt, using the format: Element@VoiceName
Example: [Livestream Host] @Sweet Female Voice: "This top is a trending must-have!"
Multiple Voice Usage: @VoiceName are independent for each character and will not override one another. This is recommended for two-character dialogue scenarios; performance may degrade in scenes with three or more characters.
Example: [Teacher] @Intellectual Female Voice: “Turn to page 20.” [Student] @Teen Voice: “Okay, teacher.”
Current Limitations: Voice creation and usage currently support Chinese and English audio/video content only. Voice consistency may be weaker in singing scenarios.

7. FAQ
Q: What languages does the current model support for voice output?

The current model only supports voice output in Chinese and English. If you input other languages, we will automatically translate them into English and generate the corresponding audio, which won't affect the overall experience. We are also rapidly expanding support for additional languages, so stay tuned!
Q: Can I generate audio only, without video?

Yes! You can go to the platform's [Sound Effect Generation] module, where you can choose either Text-to-Sound Effects or Video-to-Sound Effects:
Input text to generate standalone audio.
Upload a video to extract sound effects.
This allows you to create pure audio content without needing to generate a video.
Q: How can I improve generation results?

To achieve better generation results, we recommend optimising in the following ways:
Optimise your prompt: Keep the description clear and specific, detailing the scene, sound effect type, style, etc. Avoid overwhelming the prompt with too many complex instructions; it's best to describe each element separately.
Enhance image-text alignment: If you're using reference images, ensure the image content matches the text description. For example, if describing "outdoor camping," avoid using indoor photos as reference images to reduce conflicting information.
Set parameters accurately: Adjust the video duration, resolution, and other settings according to your specific needs. Avoid using default settings if they don't meet your expectations.
Simplify the creation scene: Focus on one core theme in each creation to avoid stacking too many elements (e.g., multiple ambient sounds + complex speech), which helps the model generate more stable and ideal content.
